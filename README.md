# Log4jdbcParser

Analyses log files generated by [log4jdbc](https://code.google.com/p/log4jdbc-log4j2).

It will count all the select, insert, delete, update statements ([sample result](sample.txt)):

* total time spent seen from JDBC driver
* total requests (including bactching statements)
* top 10 single requests with more time spent
* top 10 requests with more time spent (grouped with same exact parameters)
* top 10 requests with more time spent (grouped with different parameters)

# Usage

Configure your JDBC driver and logs as described on the [log4jdbc](https://code.google.com/p/log4jdbc-log4j2) doc.

Run your application and get a log file.

Download [LogParser.exe](https://github.com/tyrcho/Log4jdbcParser/releases/latest)

Run it from a cmd line : 
```
LogParser.exe logfile.txt analysis.txt
```
It will use UTF-8 charset by default to parse the logfile.txt


Or to specify a [valid charset](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/charset/Charset.html)
```
LogParser.exe logfile.txt analysis.txt ISO-8859-1
```

It creates the analysis.txt file.
